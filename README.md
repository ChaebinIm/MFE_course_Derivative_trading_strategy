------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Contents
###### There are two types of contents. 
1. pre-term
2. final-term project.
###### The two contents are correlated so much. Both are about "Option Delta hedging".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Specification
###### Now, I want to write the specific introduction of the two contents.
#### 1. Pre-term
###### the contents of pre-term is simple.
###### It's just making the source code of stock path generation and calculating the hedgindg cost with given condition(mean, standard deviation, etc).
###### It supposes that you have option short position and the main process is the delta hedge of this position.
###### But, in this case, you have to change your hedging frequency from too long to too short. It's simple.

#### 2. Final-term project
###### The final-term project is similar with the pre-term, but the difference is that your hedging frequency is not fixed. So, you can change it to whenever you want. But, it needs to be logical.
###### Our team did it with various ways such as delta-trigger, using volatility method, etc.
